# Interview Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Fluint.io hands-on coding assignment. The goal of this assignment is NOT to create a production-level service but to allow us to see how you naturally go about implementing solutions to problems.

## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be installed on your development machine:

- Docker Desktop
- docker-compose

## Submission Steps:

1. Fork or degit (link https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) this repository.
1. Evaluate the README.md and solve the issues laid out in the scenario.
1. Send any questions for clarification to jon@fluint.io.
1. Submit your application by emailing a link to your solution and resume to jon@fluint.io.

## The Scenario

Build a simple form that allows users to create, edit, and delete data.

This will involve:

### Frontend (fe/):

Create UI with forms to add/edit data.
Display list of data.
Ability to delete data.

### Backend (be/):

APIs to create, read, update, and delete data.
Store data in a MongoDB database.
Database (mongodb/):

Collect data with fields like id, and content.

## The Environment

This is a monorepo for an application with a Next.js frontend and a Nest.js backend. All of the core scaffolding is in place that is needed to have these projects running locally. Everything is encapsulated in a docker-compose environment (including CLI containers), so the only dependencies needed to run the application are Docker Desktop and docker-compose.

The Mongoose configuration is in place for communication between the BE Nest.js project and the FE project.

## Important Commands

Use the justfile for convenience.

```
just # lists all available commands
just <command> # runs the specified command
```

### Install dependencies

For the FE project:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm fe-cli npm install
```

For the BE project:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm be-cli npm install
```

Start the application

```
docker-compose up
```

Note: This will start up the application and make the frontend of the application available from a browser at http://localhost:8080/, and the backend API is available at http://localhost:3000/. Changes on the backend will be hot deployed to the container.

### Stop the application

```
docker-compose down
```

### Install a new library

For the FE project:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm fe-cli npm i <package>
```

For the BE project:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm be-cli npm i <package>
```

### Bash for a project

For the FE project:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm fe-cli bash
```

For the BE project:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm be-cli bash
```

## NOTES

- IMPORTANT: CORS is not enabled so make sure to use mode: 'no-cors' on all api calls to the BE
- Commands from the compose file docker-compose.cli.yml run in a container but are mounted to your local file system.
